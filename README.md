# TheBoysPowerPack

![GitHub release (with filter)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jibstack64/TheBoysPowerPack) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/powers-6-orange)

A datapack adding several powers from The Boys.

## Installation

You can install the datapack like you'd do any other. Zipped release archives can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/jibstack64/TheBoysPowerPack/releases).

**OP must be enabled on the world.**

## Usage

Use the `/trigger tb_power_up` command to give you a random ability.

Once an ability is allocated to a player, the only way to change it is by manually resetting the scoreboard value:
```
/scoreboard players PlayerName tbpp_power 0
```

You can manually set someone's ability manually by setting their `tbpp_power` value to the ID of the power.

```
/scoreboard players PlayerName tbpp_power 4
# ^ 4 = A-Train
```
